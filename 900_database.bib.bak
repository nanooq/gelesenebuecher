v Patented Sept. 28, 1948 FOOD COMPOSITION CONTAINING FUSARIA Friedrich F. Nor-d, New Yoris, N. 2!.

No Drawing. Application .ianuaryt, 1945,

Serial No. 571,694 r 5 Claims. (oi. so e) The invention relates to a new food composition to be used much in the same manner and for the same purposes as the well known yeast'products.

Attempts have been made heretofore to use some molds of the genera Aspergillus,Penicil1ium, and related kinds for the production of fats. These experiments had no practical consequences, and the genera mentioned above were never used as sources of other food constituents.

The principal object of my invention is to provide a novel food composition from molds which contains valuable nutritious and fortifying ingredients. A further object of the invention is to provide a very economic method of preparing a new mold-containing composition for nutritional and medicinal purposes. Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent hereafter.

I have found that molds of the genus Fusariurri have a composition which renders them suitable as a good food basis. Their mycelia contain not only fats, but proteins and vitamins, particularly members of the vitamin B complex such as thiamin, They have a pleasant stimulating odor which makes them readily acceptable as food and overcomes the difiiculties and objections raised against yeast in a vitamin diet. A further advantage of Fnsaria preparations is that they can be led in larger amounts or proportions than yeast compositions. i

It is well known that brewers yeast at a per cent level in a purified diet supports good growth, reproduction, and lactation in mice. Fusaria adequately replace brewers yeast in the synthetic ration and supply the necessary B complex vitamins, protein and fat. Theiollowing tests are illustrative of the favorable results obtained by the novelfood composition accordin to the invention.

Example 1 A strain of Fusarium lint Bolley (FIB) was grown on an artificial stock culture medium consisting of glucose, potassium nitrate, primary p0- tassium phosphate, and magnesium sulfate. After a growth period of three weeks, the mats were removed, washed with water, air dried, and ground up into a powder. This powder was incorporated into a; diet as follows:

Per cent Purified casein (Smaco) 25 Sucrose 45 Salts (Osborne and Mendel) 5 Fusarium Zim' Bolley (FIBL 10 Crisco '7 Lard 5 Cod liver oil 3 As the purpose of these experiments was to determine the possible effect of the members of the vitamin B complex present in Fusaria, the fat soluble vitamins in the diet were liberally supplied by the lard (linoleicacid), Crisco (vitamin E), and cod liver oil (vitamins A and D).

Eleven weanling mice of two kinds, viz. albino and Rockland black strains, were placed on the diet, which proved to be excellent for growth in both strains of mice over a period of 30 to 35 days. The growth during this period was superior to that obtained with diets containing 10% brewers yeast. The food intake averaged 3 to 3.5 grams daily. After the first month on this diet, however, growth fell ofif and an actual loss in weight occurred. The daily food intake dropped to 1 to 1.5 grams. Since-a similar loss in appetite had been observed in experiments on thiamin deficiency, a small supplement of B1 (10 micrograms daily) was either injected or fed. An immediate resumption of growth occurred and the food intake was tripled over night. This eiiectv of vitamin E1 is intelligible since FIB contained'about 20 micrograms of the vitamin per gram of dried material or approximately 2 micrograms per gram of diet. An effect comparable to the injection of vitamin B1 was obtained when the amount of FIB in the diet was doubled. Such an increase of the F13 proportion in the diet was readily accepted.-

Ezrample 2 through growth reproduction and lactation. The vitamin content of the Fusaria may be enhanced ii the mold is grown on a more complete culture medium. The thiamin content can be. of course, increased by adding vitamin Bl to the culture medium.

Example 3 trasted with 45% protein in brewer's yeast. Six

mice fed on this ration grew satisfactorily and compared favorably with those on a highly purifled ration that contained 15% casein.

This example proved'the adequacy of the protein present in FlB for feeding purposes. The growth of mice was even better when the level of FlB in the diet was raised since the 15% protein was supplying just the minimal quantities of the essential amino acids.

There are Fusaria species, e. g. Fusarium graminearum Schwabe, which contain less B complex vitamin than Fusarium lini Bolley. If mycelia 01' such a Fusarium are used in food compositions, the vitamin deficiency must be made up by addition of adequate quantities of members of the B complex family. v

The culture of Fusaria is byiar more simple and economic than the preparation of yeast. The

Fusarla may be readily grown. for instance, in the course of the alcoholic fermentation of pentoses and hexoses. and sulfite waste liquors contain abundant quantitles of these carbohydrates and constitute, therefore, excellent culture media. The mats are removed from the culture medium and dried. The dried mycelia may be ground to a'powder which may be mixed with other food constituents, preferably with carbohydrates in order to balance the high protein content of Fusaria.

- Fusarium lini Bolley is particularly suited for this purpose because it has over other Fusaria species the advantage oi growing in coherent mats, which can be readily removed and separated as a whole from the culture medium.

Various changes in the composition of the food product and in the-procedure described herein may be made without departing irom the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. 1
